# TODO
- [ ] maybe try the [archie-zola](https://www.getzola.org/themes/archie-zola/)
  theme
  - this theme supports LaTeX, which could be useful for math expressions
  - it seems like it might be more limited in structure, though?
- [ ] consider, do I want to make this a 'research only' website? Or do I want
  to make it an 'all thoughts' website?
